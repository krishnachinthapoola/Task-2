## Overview of the Project

1. Project Title:
Sentiment Analysis with Natural Language Processing

2. Overview of the Project:
In this project, I delved into Natural Language Processing (NLP) to help computers understand and analyze human language. The focus was on sentiment analysis, where I aimed to determine if the sentiment in text data — such as reviews or social media posts — is positive, negative, or neutral. This project demonstrates how NLP techniques can be used to extract valuable insights from text.

3. Objective:
The main goal was to create a sentiment analysis model capable of classifying text into various sentiment categories. I applied NLP methods to accurately analyze and predict the sentiment in text data. This involved preprocessing the text, training a machine learning model, and evaluating its effectiveness.

4. Key Activities:

Data Collection: Collected a dataset with text samples that are labeled with sentiments (positive, negative, or neutral).
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared the text by removing stop words, tokenizing, and normalizing it.
Feature Extraction: Converted the text into numerical features using techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings.
Model Training: Trained a machine learning model (e.g., Naive Bayes) on the prepared data.
Evaluation: Evaluated the model’s performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Deployment: Applied the model to classify new text data and analyze its sentiment.
5. Technologies Used:

Python: For implementing the NLP techniques.
Pandas: To handle and preprocess the data.
Scikit-learn: For training and evaluating the machine learning model.
NLTK/Spacy: For text processing tasks like tokenization and stop word removal.
TF-IDF/Word Embeddings: To transform text into numerical features.
Jupyter Notebook/Google Colab: For coding and testing in an interactive environment.
6. What I Gained and Learned from This Project:
Working on this NLP project gave me hands-on experience in processing and analyzing text data. I learned how to preprocess text, extract features, and build a sentiment analysis model. This project deepened my understanding of NLP techniques and how they can be applied to real-world problems, enhancing my skills in text analysis and machine learning.
